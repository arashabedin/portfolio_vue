I will present the MBA models in the same seven-step order in which they<br />
are taught at the best schools. This chapter offers a generic structure to apply<br />
to whatever marketing issue you may encounter. I have not neglected to use<br />
the vocabulary taught at the schools, so you can pick up on the MBA jargon<br />
and speak like a real MBA marketer. Marketing is an area especially rich in<br />
specialized vocabulary. With the correct vocabulary, even your mediocre<br />
marketing ideas can appear as brilliant ones. That may sound funny, but<br />
that’s the way ad agencies market their product, advertising.<br />
1. CONSUMER ANALYSIS<br />
Consumer Analysis→ Market → Competition → Distribution → Marketing<br />
Mix → Economics → Revise<br />
All marketing plans should begin with a look at the all-important “consumer”<br />
and his or her needs. People do not have the same needs or desires. The<br />
objective of consumer analysis is to identify segments or groups within a<br />
population with similar needs so that marketing efforts can be directly targeted<br />
to them. Starting anywhere else tends to restrict your thinking and all<br />
subsequent analysis. Several important questions must be asked to find the<br />
market that will unlock untold marketing riches:<br />
What is the need category?<br />
Who is buying and who is using the product?<br />
What is the buying process?<br />
Is what I’m selling a high- or low-involvement product?<br />
How can I segment the market?<br />
What is the need category? Who needs us and why?<br />
What is the need or use that your product addresses? The question may<br />
seem unnecessary, but in answering it you may uncover a potential market<br />
for the product that was previously overlooked. That is why this question<br />
has to be addressed first, before you<br />
4 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
begin to pollute your mind with conventional thoughts. The people at Arm<br />
&amp; Hammer baking soda have done a great deal of this type of analysis. They<br />
have made use of their powder in their own brand of toothpaste, air<br />
freshener, and carpet freshener. In addition, they profitably recommend<br />
their raw baking soda powder for hundreds of uses.<br />
Marketing Strategy Development<br />
Who is buying vs. who is using the product?<br />
Buyers many times are different from users. Women, for example, make the<br />
majority of purchases of men’s underwear and socks. If an advertising<br />
campaign wanted to target the buyer of men’s socks, it probably would be<br />
inappropriate to buy space in Sports Illustrated. Determining the buyer as<br />
well as the user provides the essential initial insights to create a marketing<br />
plan.<br />
What is the buying process?<br />
Once you have established the need, and who is making the purchases, you<br />
should try to form a hypothesis on how the product is<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 5<br />
bought. Marketing research is a prime source of information, but just as<br />
valid are your own observations, investigation, and intuition.<br />
Understanding the buying process is critical because it will lead to the<br />
possible routes to reach buyers. The buying process includes all the steps<br />
that a person takes leading to a purchase. It is also called the adoption process<br />
and the problem-solving process by some academics. Some researchers call it<br />
a Learn/Feel/Do process. Others call it AIDA for Attention/Interest/Desire/Action.<br />
I have read extensively on this topic and have boiled the theories<br />
down to five steps. For any particular product, the buying process can include<br />
one or all of the following steps:<br />
Awareness → Information Search → Evaluate Alternatives → Purchase<br />
→ Evaluate<br />
In the instance of a soap purchase, the process would look like this:<br />
Smell Body → What Should I Use? → Soap? → Ask Wife for Advice →<br />
Make Trip to the Store → Read Labels → Buy Dial Soap → Bathe →<br />
Smell Body for Odor → Buy Dial Soap Next Time<br />
The steps of the buying process explained:<br />
Awareness (Interest, Problem Recognition). “I might need something.”<br />
At some point a person will realize a need, like the need to use soap. Advertising<br />
may trigger that need. Prestige products such as designer clothes and<br />
fragrances trigger desire. They meet emotional needs such as love and group<br />
acceptance. Head &amp; Shoulders preys on the fear of a loss of love and group<br />
acceptance. You need to ask yourself, “How do consumers become aware<br />
of my product?” “Where are my targets likely to be exposed to my message?”<br />
Information Search. “Sounds good, let me find out more about it.” People<br />
involved in purchase decisions are confronted with information from a<br />
variety of sources: Consumer Reports, sales-people, specialty magazines,<br />
family, friends, and local experts. As a marketing manager, you want your<br />
target market to get as much<br />
6 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
favorable information as possible about your product when and where<br />
buyers make their buying decisions. For example, store displays play that<br />
role at the point of purchase (POP). Cover Girl Cosmetics has a display in drug<br />
stores to help buyers select colors. For the same purpose, Estée Lauder has<br />
its Clinique ladies in department stores to do its talking.<br />
Evaluate the Alternatives. Which one is best for me? This includes not<br />
only products within a category, but substitutes as well. When confronted<br />
with the high prices of automobiles, a college student may end up buying<br />
a motorcycle, a moped, or a bicycle. Depending on the importance of the<br />
product, consumers may seek additional information and advice. Car purchases<br />
often include a trip to the local mechanic or the neighborhood car<br />
buff. Placing positive information where your buyers are likely to look is<br />
one key to marketing success.<br />
At this stage of the buying process the marketing manager would like to<br />
identify the influencers of his target’s buying behavior. In the golf industry<br />
the club pro is a key influencer in the equipment-buying decision of golfers.<br />
If you can sell the pro, you can sell to the club’s members.<br />
Distribution is also crucial at the evaluation stage of the buying process.<br />
If a product is not readily available, a comparable substitute may be chosen<br />
just for convenience or immediacy of need. Coca-Cola and Pepsi’s wide<br />
distribution make it tough for any new cola competitor to ever be any more<br />
than a fringe brand. Even if you crave Dr. Brown’s Creme Soda, you probably<br />
will accept a Coke or a Pepsi when you’re thirsty at the beach.<br />
The Purchase Decision. This is the big sale. Even though the decision to<br />
buy could be “yes,” in certain instances the first purchase is only a trial. Adoption<br />
of “new and improved” Bounty paper towels as your regular brand<br />
occurs only after a successful test with those tough spills. With many bigticket<br />
items, such as ocean cruises and appliances, a trial is not possible. In<br />
those instances the decision process is more time-consuming and difficult<br />
to make because there is more risk involved. It is very important for the<br />
marketer to understand risk. Through the use of a number of marketing<br />
tools, such as advertising, knowledgeable salespeople, warranties, and<br />
printed materials, purchase risk can be reduced by offering the buyer information<br />
explaining what level of perforTHE<br />
TEN-DAY MBA / 7<br />
mance he or she can expect, as well as providing a basis of comparison with<br />
competing products.<br />
Evaluate (Postpurchase Behavior). Did I make a mistake? This conclusion<br />
can be reached either on a physical level by testing the product’s efficacy or<br />
on a psychological level by checking for peer approval. Buyer’s remorse and<br />
postpurchase dissonance are terms to describe the period of confusion that often<br />
follows a purchase. Automobile advertising, for example, is not only targeted<br />
at potential buyers, but also at recent buyers to reassure them that they didn’t<br />
screw up when they bought a Dodge Caravan minivan instead of a Honda<br />
Odyssey.<br />
In trying to understand the buying process, the first sparks of a marketing<br />
plan can be ignited into a tentative idea about advertising or promotion (to<br />
be considered later in Step 5 of the strategy development process).<br />
Research Can Help to Understand the Buying Process. Consumer research is a<br />
major tool in helping make the buying process theory useful. Research can<br />
show a marketing director where he has succeeded and where his efforts<br />
need to be redirected. For example, if the marketing director of The National,<br />
a sports newspaper that failed in 1991, had conducted a survey that would<br />
have shown him that 50 percent of men were aware of the paper, but that<br />
only 1 percent had read it, that could have been useful. That finding could<br />
have led the director to increase his efforts to gain wider newsstand distribution<br />
and to give more trial subscriptions. Research is valuable because it<br />
can be translated into tangible marketing actions. Before you embark on research,<br />
you must ask yourself:<br />
“What specific question do I need answered?”<br />
“How am I going to use the information once I have it?”<br />
If you haven’t thought through these two simple questions, you will<br />
probably waste your time and money. I can assure you that many marketing<br />
research companies will be glad to help you waste money.<br />
8 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
Is the product a high- or a low-involvement product?<br />
As the discussion of buyer behavior indicates, different products elicit different<br />
purchase behaviors because of their inherent importance to the buyer<br />
and user. If the consumer feels a high level of “risk” in buying a product,<br />
then it is considered a high-involvement product. There are several reasons<br />
for high-involvement purchase decisions:<br />
High price<br />
The need for the product’s benefit (e.g., reliability, as in the case of a pacemaker)<br />
The need for the product’s psychological reward (e.g., status, love)<br />
Stereos, clothing, cars, and professional services are examples of high-involvement<br />
purchases. They are usually higher priced and at times difficult<br />
to compare. Determining the differences between alternatives makes highinvolvement<br />
purchases difficult, especially if the buyer is not an expert.<br />
Thus, the information search can be quite extensive. When litigating a<br />
damage claim, for example, usually there is no second chance to take the<br />
case to trial. Therefore, the choice of a lawyer is a high-involvement selection.<br />
With low-involvement products the decision is simpler. For example, if a<br />
candy bar isn’t tasty, you can always pitch it and buy another one.<br />
A helpful matrix on page 10 captures the possible behaviors resulting<br />
from the interaction of the levels of involvement and product differences.<br />
By understanding the possible behaviors, you, as a marketer, may be able<br />
to take advantage of this knowledge to sell your product.<br />
This academic model does have real-world implications for action. A highinvolvement<br />
product, such as a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, would appear<br />
in the upper left-hand corner of the matrix. The model would suggest that<br />
Harley’s marketing efforts should be geared toward demonstrating its<br />
technical superiority, but also include an emotional appeal—“buy an<br />
American classic”—to engender loyalty.<br />
The marketer’s magic is at work when he or she transforms a previously<br />
low-involvement product into a high-involvement one. Athletic shoes are<br />
a prime example. Once just functional shoes for<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 9<br />
gym class, sports shoes have become a status symbol for young people and<br />
even the cause of murder on inner-city streets. The conversion of a low-involvement<br />
product to a high-involvement product can make a simple commodity<br />
product stand out against an undifferentiated field of competitors.<br />
There are four generic ways in which this can be accomplished.<br />
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR MATRIX<br />
Adapted from Henry Assael, Consumer Behavior and Marketing Action, 4th ed. (Boston:<br />
PWS-Kent Publishing Co., 1992), p. 100.<br />
Link Product to a High-Involvement Issue. Linking Procter &amp; Gamble’s<br />
Puritan no-cholesterol cooking oil to a wife’s fear of a husband’s heart attack<br />
is a classic example of an advertising ploy.<br />
Use Involving Advertising. If the advertising creates a value-expressive<br />
message about the product or service, then a product can become important.<br />
Such messages link values, such as social status and love, instead of<br />
promoting physical product attributes to differentiate the product from<br />
the competition. Pepsi tries to link being modern and youthful with its<br />
products by using singers in elaborate commercials to sell its soda.<br />
Change the Importance of Product Benefits. Products as well as services<br />
provide a variety of benefits. If through marketing action a benefit can be<br />
raised to a heightened level of importance, buyers are likely to become<br />
more involved. The beer wars of the 1980s made calories an important<br />
competitive issue. An overlooked attribute—calories—made health-conscious<br />
drinkers more aware of their<br />
10 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
purchasing decisions, and consequently Miller Lite made out like a bandit.<br />
Introduce Important Characteristic to Product. A marketer can also<br />
tinker with some of the elements of the product itself to distinguish it.<br />
When childproof caps were introduced on household cleaners, the involvement<br />
of parents in this purchase decision was heightened. The first<br />
products with protection caps stood out on the store shelves. But once all<br />
competitors copied the cap, new avenues of differentiation were needed<br />
and the purchase returned to its low-involvement status.<br />
Truly low-involvement products often are that way because a minimum<br />
level of acceptable performance is required. A thumbtack, for example, does<br />
not have a very difficult job to perform. No matter what the brand, you can’t<br />
go too wrong. If the cost of trial is low, such as for a pack of gum, involvement<br />
is difficult to stimulate.<br />
Related to involvement is the level of purchase planning. Is the purchase<br />
planned or an impulse buy? High-involvement products are usually planned<br />
while impulse products are bought on the spur of the moment. If a purchase<br />
is planned, then a buyer is likely to seek information. If not, the proximity<br />
of the product to the need is very important. Snack foods are an example of<br />
impulse buying. Midday hunger leads to the nearest junk food.<br />
Do I intend to segment the market? Why? How?<br />
I skirted around this issue in the buyer behavior section, but the question<br />
“Who is our consumer?” is central to the marketing task. If you think you<br />
have something that is for everyone, then a mass market strategy is appropriate.<br />
If your product satisfies the masses, then feed it to them. If not, you must<br />
choose a segment or segments of the market to target. Segments are homogeneous<br />
groups of similar consumers with similar needs and desires. For<br />
instance, Coca-Cola uses a mass-market approach to get everyone drinking<br />
the “real thing.” Orangina, a specialty soda, appeals to a more narrowly<br />
defined market segment. It’s priced higher and its bottle is shaped differently.<br />
Orangina appeals to a special segment of the soft drink market.<br />
Segmentation of the market serves the following functions:<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 11<br />
To identify segments large enough to serve profitably.<br />
To identify segments that can be efficiently reached by marketing<br />
efforts.<br />
To help develop marketing programs.<br />
By having a definite segment in mind, you can effectively aim and efficiently<br />
execute your marketing activities to yield the most sales and profits.<br />
Without a target, you risk wasting marketing dollars on disinterested people.<br />
There are four major segmentation variables used in segmenting consumer<br />
markets:<br />
• Geographic<br />
• Demographic<br />
• Psychographic<br />
• Behavioral<br />
Geographic Segmentation. Divides the market by country, state, region, county,<br />
and city. The federal census lists 310 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas<br />
(SMSAs) to define the major geographic population centers of the United<br />
States. Arbitron, a large media research firm, has defined a similar measure<br />
to capture the 210 major television markets of the country, called Areas of<br />
Dominant Influence (ADIs). A. C. Nielsen, a competitor, has a similar measure<br />
called Designated Market Areas (DMAs).<br />
Demographic Segmentation. Divides a population based on the following<br />
measurable variables to reach a homogeneous group of people:<br />
Age—Different generations’ different wants and needs<br />
Sex—Gender use and buying patterns<br />
Income—The ability to purchase<br />
Martial Status—Family needs<br />
Family Life Cycle—Starting out, empty nesters, etc.<br />
Education/Occupation—An indication of the sophistication of the consumer<br />
Ethnicity, Religion, and Race—Particular tastes and preferences<br />
Psychographic Segmentation. Divides the market by psychological differences:<br />
12 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
Life-style— Activities, interests, and opinions<br />
Personality—Conservative, risk-taking, status-seeking, compulsive,<br />
ambitious, authoritarian, gregarious. (People may have different hot buttons<br />
that advertising can try to trigger.)<br />
Psychographic segmentation is difficult. Personality variables are tougher<br />
to identify and quantify than demographics, but they can be very valuable.<br />
Behavioral Segmentation. Divides the market by observable purchase behaviors:<br />
Usage—Amount of use, manner of use, benefits sought<br />
Purchase Occasion—Gift, vacation, seasonal, etc.<br />
Brand Loyalty—Loyalty to one product indicates receptiveness to others.<br />
Responsiveness to Price and Promotion—Some groups respond to<br />
special marketing efforts more than others. Housewives use more coupons<br />
than single professional women.<br />
Marketers must not only select the “right” group of variables but also<br />
decide how many to use. The correct number of “useful” variables will<br />
identify the most accessible and receptive target, not the most specific. For<br />
example it is possible to describe a target segment for Corvettes as brownhaired,<br />
male, twenty-five to sixty-five years old, with income over $50,000.<br />
However, the ability to target just brown-haired men with effective advertising<br />
is limited and its usefulness would be dubious. Is brown hair a necessary<br />
segmentation variable? There are no magazines exclusively targeted to<br />
brown-haired males. Besides, blond and redheaded men may also be a<br />
reasonable market for Corvettes. You should use the following criteria to<br />
evaluate possible marketing segments:<br />
Measurability—Can you identify the segment? Can you quantify its<br />
size?<br />
Accessibility—Can you reach the segment through advertising, sales<br />
force or distributors, transportation, or warehousing?<br />
Substantiality—Is the segment large enough to bother with? Is the<br />
segment shrinking, maturing, or is it a growing segment?<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 13<br />
Profitability—Are there enough potential profits to make targeting it<br />
worthwhile?<br />
Compatibility with Competition—Are your competitors interested in<br />
this segment? Are competitors currently investigating it or is it not worth<br />
their trouble?<br />
Effectiveness—Does your company have the capabilities to adequately<br />
service this segment?<br />
Defendability—Can you defend yourself against a competitor’s attack?<br />
With that theoretical background, here’s a sample demographic profile<br />
of gourmet coffee buyers that marketers actually use:<br />
Twenty-five to fifty-four years old<br />
College educated<br />
Professional or business executive employment<br />
Childless households<br />
Household incomes greater than $50,000<br />
This “yuppie” market segment is measurable, accessible, large, and profitable.<br />
Consequently, many large coffee companies continue to target it.<br />
Even in markets that appear hopeless, there may be a segment that others<br />
overlook. Xerox controlled 88 percent of the copier market in the 1970s. The<br />
majority of its sales came from large and medium-sized units. But by 1985,<br />
Xerox had lost more than half of its market share. What happened? Xerox<br />
ignored the small-copier market. Thousands of small companies with light<br />
copy needs had to run to the local copy shop every time they had a copy<br />
job. Canon, Sharp, and Ricoh seized this market by selling a smaller and less<br />
expensive copier. With a foothold in small copiers, the Japanese competitors<br />
proceeded to topple Xerox in the large-copier segment of the market.<br />
Consumer analysis serves to “prime the pump” when you need to form<br />
a comprehensive marketing strategy. Do it first so as not to stifle your creativity<br />
with the quantitative analysis you will perform as part of the strategy<br />
development framework. On a first pass, you can make an “intuitive” choice<br />
of a target segment. After the other steps are completed it can be altered to<br />
fit an evolving marketing strategy.<br />

2. MARKET ANALYSIS<br />
Consumer →Market Analysis→ Competition → Distribution → Marketing<br />
Mix → Economics → Revise<br />
While segmentation analysis focuses on consumers as individuals, market<br />
analysis takes a broader view of potential consumers to include market sizes<br />
and trends. Market analysis also includes a review of the competitive and<br />
regulatory environment. By closely examining the market, a marketing<br />
manager can determine if the segment selected is worth the trouble of a<br />
targeted marketing effort. MBAs ask three important questions to evaluate<br />
a market:<br />
What is the relevant market?<br />
Where is the product in its product life cycle?<br />
What are the key competitive factors in the industry?<br />
What is the relevant market?<br />
The easiest mistake to make is to believe that your relevant market includes<br />
the total sales of your product’s category. In between the first and second<br />
years of my MBA education, I worked for an international trading company.<br />
I investigated the possibility of selling a Mexican gourmet ground coffee in<br />
U.S. grocery stores. It would have been misleading for me to assume that<br />
all coffee sales were in my relevant target market. Approximately $11 billion<br />
of coffee was sold in the United States in 1990. However, 60 percent of that<br />
total was sold in stores, while the other 40 percent was sold to the institutional<br />
markets, including restaurants and vending machines. That left me with a<br />
retail market of $6.6 billion.<br />
But within that larger coffee market there were additional sub-markets to<br />
investigate before arriving at my final relevant market. The gourmet coffee<br />
market accounted for $750 million, or 11 percent of the retail market’s sales.<br />
Within the gourmet coffee market, only 60 percent of the coffees sold had<br />
no artificial flavorings. My Mexican coffee had no additives and the producer<br />
refused to artificially flavor his coffee. Therefore, my relevant market was<br />
further reduced to $450 million. But of that market slice, only 55<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 15<br />
percent was sold in supermarkets. That left me with a $248 million market.<br />
That was my relevant market.<br />
Once a market segment is identified, you have to ask if it is large and accessible<br />
enough to justify your marketing effort. If the answer to that question<br />
is no, then you have what is called a “makable” product, but not a “marketable”<br />
one. Only marketable products make money.<br />
These questions are difficult to answer and involve marketing research.<br />
If it is a new product, the answers will not be readily available. Test markets<br />
may have to be used to obtain that information. This step may lead to further<br />
segment investigation.<br />
The growth and decline of consumer segments within a market should<br />
also be noted. When the market is growing, future sales growth can come<br />
from new users or existing customers. If the pie is shrinking, any sales growth<br />
has to come out of your competitors’ hide, and they’ll fight you for market<br />
share! Following the demographic trends to attract a growing senior citizen<br />
market, Lederle Laboratory, the manufacturer of Centrum vitamins, made<br />
a very minor reformulation in 1990, and successfully introduced its “Silver”<br />
formula.<br />
Where is the market in its product life cycle?<br />
Markets can be characterized by the stage that they are at in their product life<br />
cycles (PLC). Instead of being merely a factor of time, the PLC describes how<br />
a product’s sales grow as new segments become aware and begin buying it.<br />
Cellular phone service began in the early 1970s with fewer than ten thousand<br />
users. But it wasn’t until the 1990s, when the prices dropped and many could<br />
afford a unit for their cars, that a multisegment market of over six million<br />
users emerged.<br />
The PLC concept is important because the process of diffusion or adoption<br />
by the population has major implications for how a product is marketed.<br />
Each product develops its own unique PLC as it matures. Understanding<br />
the PLC can give you an MBA insight that your competitors may lack.<br />
The four generic stages of the PLC and their implications for action are:<br />
16 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
Stage 1: Introduction, “What is it?” Awareness and education are needed.<br />
If possible a trial is important. High advertising costs may be incurred to<br />
get the word out. Some vendors opt for an exclusive distribution of their<br />
products in a few select outlets at first. Initially companies make frequent<br />
product changes as customers’ needs become known. The first buyers are<br />
called the innovators, followed by the early adopters. They freely take purchase<br />
risks because their personalities or pocketbooks allow them to do so. When<br />
companies introduce new products, managers must make difficult pricing<br />
decisions because there is frequently no basis for comparison. The level of<br />
initial prices and profits has great implications regarding the outcome of<br />
future battles with competitors as well as your ability to perform additional<br />
research and development (as with products like high-definition TV and<br />
DVD).<br />
Stage 2: Growth, “Where can I get it?” Education is still important, but at<br />
this stage competition is intensified. The early majority becomes interested.<br />
As more consumers become familiar with a product they examine the new<br />
models to decide which to buy, not whether they should buy. When buyers<br />
get to the store they start comparing features. To make the product more<br />
accessible, marketers often choose a selective distribution to gain a greater<br />
number and variety of outlets. At this stage it is important to boost your<br />
sales volume ahead of the competition in order to reduce costs through<br />
production and advertising efficiencies. This helps a company gain the<br />
competitive advantage in the next stage of the PLC (e.g., palm organizer).<br />
Stage 3: Maturity, “Why this one?” At this stage the late majority of the mass<br />
market buys. Because people are accustomed to buying the product and the<br />
differences are few, brand loyalty plays a dominant role. Price competition<br />
often becomes heated in stable markets because additional market share<br />
comes directly from your competitors. The product’s features that were so<br />
important in the growth stage have become standardized. Because there is<br />
less differentiation on product attributes, advertising is used as a vehicle to<br />
differentiate products. Marketing managers try to segment their target<br />
market as much as possible to meet specific unmet conTHE<br />
TEN-DAY MBA / 17<br />
sumer needs. In mature markets competitors are ferreting out all possible<br />
segments. All possible channels of distribution are also considered using a<br />
mass market distribution strategy (e.g., CD players, VCRs).<br />
The Product Life Cycle<br />
Stage 4: Decline, “How much?” As a product ages in its PLC, it is likely that<br />
its competitors offer similar products. Even the most timid consumers, the<br />
laggards, find it safe to buy the product at this late stage. (If it does cause<br />
cancer, the FDA usually has found out by now.) Consumers turn a deaf ear<br />
to advertising because they know that all competing products are the same.<br />
At this stage many companies focus their efforts on reducing price if competition<br />
remains, or slowly increasing prices if the competitive field thins.<br />
Trade relations are key to staying on the retail shelf at this point, because<br />
without the excitement of novelty, distributors and<br />
18 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
retailers would rather allocate space to newer and potentially more profitable<br />
products. The effort to sell the trade is popularly called relationship marketing<br />
(e.g., black-and-white TVs, phonographs, and cassettes).<br />
With some products the maturity phase does not necessarily mean death.<br />
Products can be reinvigorated after a period of maturity and a new growth<br />
phase can begin. Baseball trading cards underwent such a revival, encouraged<br />
by Topps Inc.’s marketing efforts in the 1980s, and lost their luster in the<br />
1990s.<br />
In some cases, lingering death throes produce large profits for the last<br />
manufacturer. In the vacuum tube business, which supplies electronic tubes<br />
for old TVs, radios, and other equipment, Richardson Electronics is the survivor<br />
in an industry once dominated by GE, RCA, Westinghouse, and<br />
Sylvania. Using an end game strategy, the remaining producers can extract<br />
large profits from customers since they have nowhere else to go for their<br />
replacement parts.<br />
What are the key competitive factors within the industry?<br />
The basis of competition in each industry or market tends to be different. It<br />
has a major impact on how a business attacks its market. There are five major<br />
key competitive factors that constitute the battleground in most industries:<br />
• Quality<br />
• Price<br />
• Advertising<br />
• Research and Development<br />
• Service<br />
In the fast food industry, for example, intensive advertising and promotion<br />
are key. In industries providing raw materials to others, price and service<br />
are key. In my investigation of the coffee industry, I found price and quality<br />
to be the basis of competition. When developing a marketing plan, you may<br />
want to try to change the basis of competition to one that favors your firm,<br />
but the key underlying competitive factors cannot be ignored.<br />

3. ANALYSIS OF YOUR COMPANY VERSUS THE COMPETITION<br />
Consumer → Market →Competitive Analysis→ Distribution → Marketing<br />
Mix → Economics → Revise<br />
By this stage the marketer has preliminarily chosen a consumer segment<br />
toward which to direct his or her efforts. Now, a plan to beat the competition<br />
must be developed. You need to look at yourself and at the competition with<br />
the same level of objectivity. What are your advantages? What things do<br />
you do well? (MBAs call them core competencies.) What are your weaknesses?<br />
How can your company capitalize on its strengths or exploit your competitors’<br />
weaknesses? The following questions help to flush that out.<br />
What is your company good at and what is the competition good at?<br />
• Distribution (Frito-Lay)<br />
• New Product Development and Introduction (3M)<br />
• Advertising (Absolut vodka)<br />
Who are we in the marketplace?<br />
• Market Size and Relative Market Share<br />
• Financial Position<br />
• Historic Performance and Reputation<br />
What are our resources versus those of the competition?<br />
• People<br />
• Technology, Research<br />
• Sales Forces<br />
• Cash<br />
• Trade Relations<br />
• Manufacturing<br />
Barriers to entry to new competitors in a market play an important role in<br />
assessing the competition. Barriers are conditions or hurdles that new competitors<br />
have to overcome before they can enter the market. The availability<br />
of cash and specialized knowledge are such barriers. The pharmaceutical<br />
industry, for example,<br />
20 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
is dominated by a few companies. To be a player, a company needs a large<br />
sales force, research labs, and a large bank account to pay for it all. Because<br />
of these barriers, most small companies team up with large ones if they have<br />
a promising new drug to peddle.<br />
If in an industry the barriers to entry are low, the playing field becomes<br />
very crowded. Savvy marketers should plan for that eventuality by trying<br />
to form a marketing strategy that new competitors cannot easily copy. This<br />
is more fully discussed later in the book in the Strategy chapter.<br />
During my coffee investigation, I looked at what my company had to offer.<br />
It didn’t have much. It didn’t have any experience in the United States. We<br />
lacked distribution, advertising expertise, a reputation, and cash. The only<br />
thing my Mexican employer had to offer was quality packaged coffee. What<br />
could a small competitor do against Folger’s and Maxwell House coffees?<br />
After much questioning, and feeling a little ill, I hoped that there might be<br />
a large food company that would like to enter into a joint venture. We would<br />
supply the coffee and the partner would do the distribution and marketing.<br />
We could piggyback, not unlike what small pharmaceutical companies do,<br />
recognizing that some profit is better than none.<br />
What are the market shares of the industry players?<br />
Many tracking services are available for consumer products such as Selling<br />
Areas Marketing Inc. (SAMI) and A. C. Nielsen. Checkout scanners and<br />
warehouse tracking collect supermarket sales data. However, for industrial<br />
products, such as manufacturing equipment, the information is less accessible.<br />
Trade associations are a good source.<br />
The shift of share over time is extremely important. In the battle for “instant”<br />
coffee sales in the grocery store, for example, the top three competitors<br />
controlled 95 percent of the market in 1989, up 5 percent from 1986. They<br />
were Kraft Foods (37 percent), Nestle (34 percent), and Procter &amp; Gamble<br />
(24 percent). Little was left for a new entrant.<br />
Market share leverage is a key concept to consider when examining market<br />
shares within an industry. The companies with larger market shares relative<br />
to their competition usually enjoy higher<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 21<br />
profits. Larger competitors can produce more cheaply on a per-unit basis<br />
because they can spread their costs over more units. A smaller competitor<br />
cannot afford to spend as much on either research or more efficient equipment,<br />
because the smaller sales volume cannot support the burden. If I had<br />
been charged with a new instant coffee to sell, I would have had to reconsider<br />
entry into the declining instant-coffee market dominated by bigger, lowercost<br />
competitors. Fortunately for my Mexican coffee’s entry, in 1989 18 percent<br />
of the “ground” coffee market was controlled by smaller competitors.<br />
And that share had increased from 16 percent in 1986. This constituted a far<br />
more favorable environment for a new entrant such as my Mexican ground<br />
coffee.<br />
How does my product perceptually map against the competition?<br />
The perceptual mapping technique is a graphic way to view and compare your<br />
product against the competitors’. A commonly used grid is price and quality,<br />
but many others are possible and useful. Maps are another MBA technique<br />
to generate ideas for marketing for your product, and perceptual maps may<br />
highlight an unserved market segment by showing how the consumer perceives<br />
competing products, regardless of the physical reality of performance.<br />
Perceptions are paramount in marketing, just as they are in politics. In the<br />
paper towel industry, for example, towel strength and decorator appeal are<br />
very important. As an example, using my own judgment, I have created a<br />
“hypothetical” map on page 23. Notice that Bounty found itself a very<br />
profitable market segment by providing strength and a pretty pattern.<br />
By visualizing how your product maps versus the competition, you may<br />
gain an insight into how to market your existing product, make product<br />
changes, or add additional products in a comprehensive marketing strategy.<br />
If your company has many products within a category, then you are said<br />
to have depth of line. In the paper towel market no one producer dominates<br />
the category. But over in the dog food aisle, Ralston’s depth chokes the<br />
shelves with Dog Chow, Puppy Chow, HiPro, O.N.E., Lucky Dog, and at<br />
least six other brands.<br />
If your company has many products in a variety of product classes, you<br />
are said to have breadth of product line. Kimberly-Clark<br />
22 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
has a wide breadth of paper products in several categories: Hi-Dri paper<br />
towels, Kleenex tissue, Kotex sanitary napkins, and Huggies and Pull-Ups<br />
diapers. Depth and breadth of product lines can be cleverly used in a blocking<br />
strategy to prevent competitors from gaining access to the channels of distribution.<br />
If they are not on the shelf, your competition can’t make any sales.<br />
Perceptual Mapping<br />
Paper Towel Brands (Hypothetical)<br />
In the dog food industry, competitors found other ways around Ralston<br />
to reach doggie owners. Iams sold $350 million of Eukanuba brand premium<br />
dog food in 1996 to breeders and specialty stores. In the same year Hill’s Pet<br />
Products, a division of Colgate-Palmolive, pushed $750 million of Science<br />
Diet pet food and other products through veterinarians’ offices.<br />

4. REVIEW OF THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS<br />
Consumer → Market → Competition →Distribution Analysis→ Marketing<br />
Mix → Economics → Revise<br />
Marketers speak of the avenues to the consumer as the channels of distribution.<br />
There are often many ways of reaching your customers, as described with<br />
dog food sales. Distribution channel analysis is critical, because the choice<br />
of channel influences the price you can charge, and, consequently, the profit<br />
margins that you may enjoy. Three questions should be asked to provide<br />
you with a basis for your distribution decision:<br />
How can my product reach the consumer?<br />
How much do the players in each distribution channel profit?<br />
Who holds the power in each distribution channel available?<br />
How can my product reach the consumer?<br />
In the case of many mail-order catalogs, there is a direct link between the<br />
marketer and the final consumer. A catalog manufacturer of clothing has a<br />
direct pulse on sales, returns, pricing, and consumer tastes. As manufacturers<br />
of grocery items, brand managers are distanced from the buyer. Cereal, for<br />
instance, must go through wholesalers and retailers before reaching the<br />
consumer. Those middlemen are called channel intermediaries. As a strategist,<br />
the marketing manager must outline all the paths to the consumer to develop<br />
a plan.<br />
Commonly used channel intermediaries to the consumer are:<br />
• Wholesalers<br />
• Distributors<br />
• Sales Representatives<br />
• Sales Forces<br />
• Retailers<br />
How do the players in each distribution channel profit?<br />
As I mentioned, it is very helpful to understand all the paths to the consumer<br />
in order to know all the possible ways to market<br />
24 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
your product. Take the time to draw them out on paper. A channel sketch<br />
can also give you the insight into the retail price that must be charged to<br />
make a profit.<br />
Everyone who touches the merchandise takes a cut, which is called their<br />
margin. Participants in the distribution chain are said to “take margin” from<br />
the manufacturer. As a manufacturer of a product, you do not “give” the<br />
channel margin; there is no charity involved. Channel participants in most<br />
industries calculate their cut as a markup on selling price. Canadian and some<br />
U.S. drug firms use a markup on cost, but they are the exceptions. The selling<br />
price is not the ultimate retail price, but the price at which one intermediary<br />
sells goods to the next intermediary in the chain. The retail price is what a<br />
consumer pays.<br />
Because of my experience in the coffee industry, I will use coffee retailing<br />
to demonstrate the economics of the channels of distribution. At each level<br />
of the chain, the intermediary buys the coffee from the previous level and<br />
takes a margin based on the sales price to the next level. The margin is not<br />
based on cost.<br />
This is how one dollar’s worth of coffee beans, in my example, can reach<br />
the consumer at a price of six dollars. At each level, the channel participant<br />
adds value and incurs costs by either roasting, grinding, and packaging the<br />
coffee beans; promoting the brand; or distributing and shelving the packaged<br />
coffee for the consumer. I have outlined on page 27 what I estimated were<br />
the channel economics in 1989 for Maxwell House’s gourmet Private Collection<br />
coffee.<br />
At each level in the distribution channel, the participant performs its<br />
function, takes its margin, and sells to the next participant closer to the<br />
consumer. If a coffee processor, such as Kraft Foods, believes that its gourmet<br />
Maxwell House Private Collection coffee brand must retail at $4.00 per pound<br />
rather than $6.00, then the economics of the chain must change. Let’s work<br />
backward through the chain to see its effect on the prices charged at each<br />
level.<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 25<br />
Selling Price × (1 – Markup %) = The Preceding Distribution Level’s<br />
Selling Price<br />
Working backward through the distribution chain:<br />
$4.00 Retail Price to Consumer × (1 – .23 Retail Markup) = $3.08<br />
$3.08 Wholesaler Price to Retailer × (1 – .09 Wholesale Markup) = $2.80<br />
$2.80 would be Kraft Foods’ (the Processor’s) Price to Wholesalers<br />
At the $4.00 price, Kraft Foods’ brand manager must ask if $1.75<br />
($2.80–$1.05) per pound is a sufficient margin to cover costs and provide an<br />
adequate profit. If the answer is no, the brand manager must reexamine the<br />
marketing plan’s channel mathematics. Because marketing strategy is a circular<br />
process, another price, manufacturing process, or cost may have to be<br />
altered. Such changes could affect all the other elements of the plan.<br />
The relative power of the channel participants can dictate pricing decisions<br />
based on the economics of the channel chosen. In Kraft Foods’ case, the brand<br />
manager could have opted for the lower $4.00 retail price in the grocery<br />
store. However, he chose $6.00 to yield his desired profits.<br />
Kraft Foods decided to use an alternative channel in addition to grocery<br />
stores. Kraft “bypassed” the grocery trade’s middlemen and sold its Gevalia<br />
and Garraway coffee brands directly to coffee lovers by mail order at a price<br />
over $8.00 per pound. With most products there are usually a variety of<br />
ways to reach the consumer. Each channel has its own channel margin<br />
mathematics. By understanding the math you are better able to make a choice<br />
of channel.<br />
Who has the power in the channels?<br />
The question of channel power is very crucial in selecting where to sell. If<br />
your product is unique and in demand, then the manufacturer generally has<br />
the power to outline the terms of the rela-<br />
26 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
tionship. If not, the channel’s intermediaries will be able to dictate the terms<br />
to take as much margin as possible.<br />
Channel of Distribution for Maxwell House’s Private Collection Coffee<br />
with Channel Margins and Prices<br />
In the grocery trade, the power of the channel has shifted from the manufacturers<br />
to the supermarket chains. As smaller grocery chains consolidated<br />
into larger super chains in the 1980s, the larger chains’ management realized<br />
that they held the prized real estate, “shelf space.” Each stock keeping unit<br />
(SKU) on the shelf takes space. Each product must be tracked, shelved, and<br />
invenTHE<br />
TEN-DAY MBA / 27<br />
toried. (When Mazola cooking oil produces three sizes, it takes up three<br />
(SKUs.) With a finite amount of store and warehouse space, the shelf real<br />
estate has become valuable, and retailers want to be paid for carrying each<br />
SKU. Marketers even diagram their shelves like architects in drawings called<br />
planograms and fight over best placement.<br />
Packaged goods companies, large and small, must often pay slotting fees<br />
to the chains to reserve their “slots” on their shelves for both new and existing<br />
products. In the 1970s the packaged good giants could force their products<br />
on the trade. When there were many smaller grocery chains, Procter &amp;<br />
Gamble and Kraft Foods could play one chain against another by threatening<br />
to withhold their popular products. That is no longer the case.<br />
Unfortunately, slotting fees can run into millions of dollars for a new<br />
product introduction. Therefore, in practice, slotting fees bar smaller competitors<br />
from selling in the supermarket. A maker of an excellent pizza in<br />
the Midwest that I knew failed to get off the ground because it could not<br />
afford the bribes necessary for space. Slotting fees are a “hot topic” in retailing.<br />
Feel free to interject this topic into MBA conversation as often as you<br />
like.<br />
5. DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARKETING MIX<br />
Consumer → Market → Competition → Distribution →Plan the Marketing<br />
Mix→ Economics → Revise<br />
Based on judgments developed in the analysis of the consumer, the market,<br />
the competition, and the distribution channels, the marketing manager must<br />
make a set of tangible decisions. MBAs call it the action plan. Marketing<br />
managers choose what mix of marketing efforts should be made. The mix is<br />
commonly referred to as the Four P’s of marketing.<br />
The development of the marketing mix is an evolutionary process whose<br />
goal is an internally consistent and mutually supportive plan. That cannot be<br />
overemphasized. Tinkering with one P in the mix generally means the<br />
marketing strategist must alter all the other P’s in some way, because one P<br />
affects the others.<br />
28 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
The Marketing Mix<br />
Product Decisions<br />
How does my product fit with my other products?<br />
How will I differentiate my product?<br />
How does the product life cycle affect my plans?<br />
How does the product fit with my existing product line?<br />
This question tries to identify areas of synergy among your products, or<br />
uncover a constraint on your activities. For example, if “The Dependability<br />
People” at Maytag added dishwashers to their line of clothes washers and<br />
dryers, the product, the customers, and the retailers for the dishwashers<br />
would be shared with their existing line. There would be a fit with this line<br />
extension. But if Maytag wanted to sell personal hair dryers, the fit would<br />
be questionable.<br />
How will I differentiate my product?<br />
Differentiation is a broad issue that includes any way that a marketer can<br />
distinguish his product from the field. Consequently there are many ways<br />
to do it.<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 29<br />
• Feature—Capabilities<br />
• Fit—Tailoring<br />
• Styling—Functional, visual<br />
• Reliability—Warranties, return policies<br />
• Packaging—Color size, shape, protection<br />
• Sizes—Clothing, appliances, computers, and luggage sizes<br />
• Service—Timeliness, courtesy, accuracy<br />
• Brand Naming—Labeling<br />
If Ralph Lauren had used his real name, Ralph Lifshitz, he would have<br />
foregone the psychological benefits derived from his Ralph Lauren’s Polo<br />
label on $1.3 billion in clothing, cologne, and bedding in 1998. Lifshitz<br />
somehow fails to convey the image of English aristocracy.<br />
In many cases the so-called brand equity of one product can be transferred<br />
to new products using a brand or line extension strategy that differentiates it<br />
from the pack. Kraft Foods has chosen to place the Jell-O brand name on its<br />
new pudding and ice cream treats. The Jell-O brand bestows upon the new<br />
products all the goodwill and brand recognition (brand equity) that Jell-O<br />
earned over decades. It would take many years of expensive advertising to<br />
establish the brand equity of the Jell-O brand. Accordingly, almost 70 percent<br />
of the twenty-four thousand new product introductions since 1987 were line<br />
and brand extensions. If stretched too far, a brand’s equity can be diluted<br />
and its effectiveness with consumers devalued.<br />
The choice of any one of these product differentiation techniques affects<br />
the entire marketing process, as it lays the groundwork for your promotional<br />
efforts. A product can be differentiated from the competition by creative<br />
advertising and promotion, even if competing products are physically<br />
identical.<br />
Perceptual maps and positioning can help to differentiate the product. All the<br />
product attributes mentioned affect the positioning of a product in the marketplace.<br />
The marketer can always call upon his company’s product engineers<br />
to develop a product’s physical characteristics if the profits justify it. As my<br />
perceptual map of paper towels indicated, consumers have specific needs<br />
within a product class and they perceive each product differently. The<br />
30 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
marketer’s job is to uniquely position the product (using a perceptual map<br />
as a guide if desired) to earn its place in the market. That place is often called<br />
a product’s niche in the market. As pictured in the perceptual mapping of<br />
paper towels, James River’s Brawny brand is positioned as the tough, durable<br />
towel for really dirty cleanups. Hopefully the brand manager will choose a<br />
niche that will yield the most sales and profits by targeting a market segment<br />
his product serves best. Positioning is inexorably tied to the market segment<br />
selected through your consumer and market analysis.<br />
How does the product life cycle affect my plans?<br />
Based on the point in the product life cycle (PLC), different aspects of the<br />
product become more important in the competitive battles. The previous<br />
discussion of the PLC noted that product features are extremely important<br />
to differentiate products in the growth phase, while branding is increasingly<br />
more important in the maturity phase. The emphasis on multiplay features<br />
on compact disc players, for example, currently indicates the growth phase<br />
of the PLC. In the mature cassette deck market, the battles over auto reverse<br />
and Dolby noise reduction have already been played out. Whatever the<br />
choices for the product, product decisions will have a definite effect on the<br />
other P’s of the mix.<br />
Product Place Promotion Price<br />
Place of Sale Decisions: Where to Sell?<br />
In your review of the distribution channels, the goal was to determine what<br />
avenues exist and what margins are available. At this stage, having made<br />
product decisions and a choice of target market, the marketer has to choose<br />
an appropriate channel to fit with the product and the intended buyers.<br />
What distribution strategy should I use?<br />
On what basis should I choose a channel of distribution?<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 31<br />
What type of distribution strategy should I select?<br />
• Exclusive—Sell in only one outlet in each market<br />
• Selective—Sell in only a few outlets in each market<br />
• Mass or Intensive—Sell in as many outlets as possible<br />
The place of sale affects the perception of your product. The choice of<br />
distribution is an evolving process that matches the product’s intended diffusion<br />
along the product life cycle, as described in the market analysis passage.<br />
A distribution strategy can differentiate your product from the crowd.<br />
For example, if a new designer chooses to sell exclusively at Neiman Marcus,<br />
it gives a certain cachet to the product. Consumers tend to perceive certain<br />
attributes in a product, such as style, quality, and price, based on the point<br />
of sale. The same designer may choose to selectively sell in only better department<br />
stores to provide greater initial sales volume. The California marketer<br />
of car window sun shields had no such concern, and selected a mass distribution<br />
strategy. The company wanted to distribute the cardboard shade as<br />
widely and quickly as possible. That choice made sense since the shades,<br />
unlike designer clothing, did not have any status appeal and could be easily<br />
copied and manufactured.<br />
Each of these distribution methods places certain responsibilities upon<br />
the manufacturer and the retailer. By choosing to be selective, the manufacturer<br />
may be “obligated” to provide high quality, good service, and possibly<br />
cooperative payments (co-ops) for promotional support. When manufacturers<br />
share the costs of advertising with retailers, that is called cooperative advertising.<br />
In distribution relationships involving manufacturers’ incentives, the retailer<br />
is also obligated. Retailers may be “obliged” to pay special attention<br />
to the product by giving it preferential placement, special promotion, display,<br />
and sales attention. If those obligations are not met, the contract is breached<br />
and the relationship can be severed. In Ralph Lauren’s case he believed that<br />
his Polo clothing line was so unique that he became the first designer to demand<br />
separate boutique space in department stores. Ralph provided the<br />
image and the margins sought by retailers. The retailers were in turn obliged<br />
to provide Ralph Lauren with special placement and selling efforts.<br />
32 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
Which channels of distribution to choose?<br />
It depends…on a variety of factors. There is usually more than one choice.<br />
However, if a channel is integrated into a mutually supportive and internally<br />
consistent strategy, many choices can potentially be successful. Three factors<br />
should serve as a guide to make a selection.<br />
Product Specifics. Another factor to consider is the level of attention needed<br />
for the sale. This is related to the level of complexity of the product, the<br />
newness, or the price. The product may indicate a need for your own sales<br />
force despite the costs. On the other hand, products such as candy and soft<br />
drinks are sold through a series of wholesalers and distributors before<br />
reaching the store shelves. These products are simple and do not require<br />
direct control by the manufacturer over the presentation and sale.<br />
Need for Control. The ability to motivate the channels to carry your product<br />
effectively and appropriately enters into the placement decision. The further<br />
the manufacturer is removed from the consumer with distributors, wholesalers,<br />
and jobbers, the less control the manufacturer has over how a product<br />
is sold. Pharmaceutical companies usually have their own sales forces, also<br />
called captive sales forces, that are thoroughly trained to provide credible<br />
information to doctors. If Merck or Pfizer had to rely on an independent<br />
sales force they would not have absolute control over their training or conduct<br />
in the field.<br />
Margins Desired. The analysis of the channels of distribution helps to determine<br />
the potential profits available. Where are the margins taken at each<br />
level? Can your company deliver the product through the channels at a<br />
competitive price and still reserve enough margin for itself? Based on the<br />
available margins, channel decisions can be made. In the case of radar detectors,<br />
Cincinnati Microwave opted to sell directly to the public through<br />
magazine display advertising. They chose not to sell through electronics<br />
stores or other general merchandisers. Their management believed that the<br />
technological superiority of their Escorts and Passports would help the units<br />
sell themselves. Cincinnati Microwave chose<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 33<br />
to capture the entire retail margin and to cut out all the middlemen who<br />
typically distribute and sell electronics. Their strategy faltered because they<br />
failed to maintain their product’s technical edge.<br />
Product Place Promotion Price<br />
Promotional Decisions<br />
Promotion includes all the advertising and selling efforts of the marketing<br />
plan. Goal setting is paramount in developing a promotional campaign. You<br />
need to know the mission you want to accomplish before you can begin to<br />
draft or spend the promotion budget. The ultimate goal of promotion is to<br />
affect buyer behavior; therefore the desired behavior must be defined. Different<br />
products, at different stages of the PLC, with different levels of involvement<br />
and complexity, require different promotional efforts to perform different<br />
missions. The promotional mission chosen for your product must be<br />
consistent with the buying process outlined in your consumer analysis.<br />
Buying Process / Promotional Mission<br />
Awareness / Inform about product, prompt a need message<br />
Interest / Provide compelling message, solve a need message<br />
Trial / Motivate action<br />
Repurchase / Cue to buy, increase usage<br />
Loyalty / Reinforce brand or image, special promotions<br />
Push or Pull Strategy? As with distribution, promotional efforts should be<br />
guided by a strategy. Pull strategies are those efforts that pull buyers to the<br />
outlets that carry your product. TV pitches that instruct viewers “to ask for<br />
Perdue chicken by name at your local grocer” pull consumers to the stores<br />
that carry it. Another important mission of promotion is to encourage the<br />
distribution channels to stock and sell a product to consumers. Such efforts<br />
are a push strategy. Beer distributors, for instance, spend a great deal of their<br />
time trying to court bar owners to stock and promote their brew on tap. Most<br />
plans have an element of both push and pull strategies. In the beer industry<br />
they spend heavily to advertise the brand as well as to gain greater bar distribution.<br />
To pull buyers to a store or to push the distribution channel to<br />
34 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
stock and sell, there are five general categories of promotional efforts:<br />
Advertising<br />
Personal Selling<br />
Sales Promotion<br />
Public Relations and Publicity<br />
Direct Selling<br />
Advertising. Advertising takes many forms: television, radio, outdoor (billboards),<br />
magazine, and newspaper. Two important things to keep in mind<br />
are your intended mission and the quantitative measurement of exposure<br />
required to accomplish it.<br />
Please pay attention to the following measurement vocabulary. This is<br />
what you pay for when you buy advertising. The tendency for the uninitiated<br />
is to listen to the ad world’s babble, not understand it, and buy their wares<br />
anyway. Buying advertising is just like buying marketing research—know<br />
what and why you are buying—buyer beware.<br />
Reach and frequency are key quantitative measurements of media goals.<br />
Reach is the percentage of the target market who see and hear your promotion<br />
or advertisement. Frequency is the number of times they saw or heard<br />
it. Marketers refer to the number of times a person is exposed to a message<br />
as the total impressions made on that audience. Because of the buying behavior<br />
associated with different products, different mixes of reach and frequency<br />
are required to induce purchase. When multiplied, Reach X Frequency<br />
equals a measure called gross rating points (GRPs). Add the GRPs together<br />
and you get total rating points (TRPs). GRP and TRP are the measures by<br />
which radio, TV, and outdoor advertising is sold and purchased.<br />
The desired demographics and segmentation variables of the audiences<br />
delivered also enter prominently into the equation. A TV station’s regional<br />
golf program that delivers active, middle-aged golfing males with incomes<br />
over $100,000 in the Southwest could be efficiently used to advertise a variety<br />
of products. A TV program that attracts a muddled mix of demographic<br />
audiences is less valuable per audience member. Even if you have the right<br />
media vehicle, scheduling is key in reaching your target.<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 35<br />
High GRPs do not guarantee sales. The message delivered is also a key<br />
determinant. When advertising people refer to the message, copy (wording),<br />
or layout of advertising, they call it the creative, a noun. Ad agency people<br />
who develop the ideas are called creatives.<br />
Magazine and newspaper advertising is purchased based on the size and<br />
segmentation variables of their circulations. Magazines have a longer shelf<br />
life, but newspapers deliver a much more immediate and focused geographic<br />
readership which is best for sale promotions. Both of these print audiences<br />
are bought on a cost per thousand (CPM) readers basis. A comprehensive<br />
listing of media and mailing list prices is provided by SRDS (Standard Rate<br />
&amp; Data Service), in a series of telephone book-sized volumes.<br />
A competitive measure of media is share of voice. Using this measure, an<br />
advertiser can target a certain percentage of media spending by all competitors<br />
within a product category. Advertisers believe that to have an impact<br />
through the competitive media clutter and noise, the relative spending level<br />
is just as important as the absolute dollars spent.<br />
Through the clutter, it would have been futile to run a TV ad to promote<br />
the tiny coffee brand that I managed during my summer internship. A small<br />
competitor had no chance against the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft Foods,<br />
and Nestlé, who together spent over $200 million in advertising in 1999. Any<br />
affordable ad would have been drowned out by the giants.<br />
Remember, each medium has its strengths in reaching people. Some are<br />
more selective than others. Marketers want to reach their intended targets<br />
as efficiently as possible to induce the desired buying behavior.<br />
Personal Selling. Marketers choose personal selling when they need to make<br />
direct contact with the buyer. A salesperson can personalize your message<br />
to fit the buyer’s needs and situation, and can field objections and questions<br />
in this interactive process. This avenue is generally the most expensive element<br />
in any marketing mix because of the high cost of labor and commissions<br />
paid.<br />
Managers of products that are new, complex, or expensive find that the<br />
benefits of personal selling often outweigh their high cost. Because some<br />
target markets are inaccessible by other media<br />
36 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
vehicles, personal selling is sometimes the only means to reach consumers.<br />
Water purification systems, pharmaceuticals, encyclopedias, copiers, and<br />
industrial products widely utilize personal selling in their marketing mixes.<br />
Current theory holds that personal selling is a problem-solving and consultation<br />
process. Professor Derek A. Newton of the Darden School at the University<br />
of Virginia saw personal selling as having evolved over the years in four<br />
stages: Music Man, Animated Catalog, Magic Formula, and Problem Solver.<br />
Before World War I it was believed that the “Music Man” approach to selling<br />
was the key to success. It was the salesperson’s personality that enabled him<br />
to charm his customer into buying. After World War I, the “Animated<br />
Catalog” was considered the right way to sell. Vacuum cleaner salespeople<br />
knew all the facts about their products, and their sales presentations were<br />
rehearsed catalog readings. During the 1930s the slick pitch or “magic formula”<br />
was thought to be the best sales approach. Encyclopedia sales reps<br />
would control the presentation and lead the customer down a “mapped-out<br />
road” to a “sure sale.” Many books currently on the bookstore shelves claim<br />
they hold the “secret” of how to close a sale. Today, academics agree that<br />
personal selling still requires some element of pizzazz and cataloglike product<br />
knowledge, but sales forces must also have extensive knowledge of the<br />
prospect’s needs and buying processes to be successful. Salespeople should<br />
sell benefits that solve customers’ problems, rather than simply peddling<br />
products.<br />
Sales Promotion. Sales promotion is designed to elicit the desired behavior<br />
from the consumer, the sales force, and other channel participants. Sales<br />
promotions are designed to complement and reinforce other promotional<br />
efforts, especially advertising. Each type of promotion has its own associated<br />
vocabulary that you should be aware of. If you are not a marketer, knowing<br />
the vocabulary does not make you an expert, but it can sure help you to engage<br />
in intelligent marketing conversation, if need be. There are two types<br />
of promotions: those directed toward the consumer, and those directed at<br />
the distribution channels.<br />
Consumer sales promotions techniques available are coupons, refund offers,<br />
samples, premiums, and contests.<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 37<br />
Coupons are a direct way to pass a price reduction on to consumers. As a<br />
manufacturer, if you give retailers a discount in hopes that they will pass it<br />
along to consumers, you may be sadly disappointed. Marketers use coupons<br />
to encourage trial, brand switching, and brand loyalty. Grocery coupons are<br />
most often placed in a special coupon section of the Sunday paper called<br />
freestanding inserts (FSI). The leader in FSIs is Valassis Inserts, which prints<br />
almost half of the $100 billion in face value of coupon savings distributed<br />
annually in Sunday FSIs.<br />
Refunds are generally used to accelerate the normal consumer purchase<br />
cycles. Refunds are usually used to increase the quantity or frequency of<br />
purchase by encouraging buyers to stock up. Battery manufacturers frequently<br />
use refund offers. Such offers have been cleverly used to stock up<br />
consumers just before a competitor’s promotion or product introduction.<br />
Samples are a high-cost way of introducing a new product. Sampling requires<br />
a cash investment to produce and stock the smaller-sized packages.<br />
Samples are properly used for products whose benefits are “sensory in<br />
nature” and cannot be communicated effectively by advertising. Sampling<br />
may also be effective for products that consumers would view as risky in<br />
switching to a new brand, or that may have a high probability of generating<br />
word of mouth (WOM) activity after use. Many new shampoos use free or<br />
low-cost samples since their benefits are sensory. Consumers are reluctant<br />
to risk four dollars to try a whole bottle. Sampling reduces the buyer’s risk<br />
of trial.<br />
Premiums are items offered at low or no cost to purchasers of a product.<br />
Self-liquidating premiums are those for which the price charged covers just<br />
costs. Hershey has periodically offered watches and Christmas ornaments<br />
as premiums. To get the goodies, chocolate lovers have to send in wrappers<br />
as proof of purchase. Mr. Bubble, the happy pink bubble-bath man, is pictured<br />
on inexpensive T-shirts, beach towels, and sweatshirts that are printed<br />
on every box.<br />
Contests and sweepstakes are a popular promotion and the most restricted<br />
legally, because they border on gambling. A very thorough analysis of the<br />
game rules and the laws must be conducted to avoid a disaster. State<br />
gambling laws must be investigated to ensure compliance. The game rules<br />
and odds of winning must also<br />
38 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
be scrutinized to ensure that the promotional budget will cover the forecasted<br />
costs. In 1984 McDonald’s ran a summer Olympics medal game. Every time<br />
the United States won, game pieces could be redeemed for free food and<br />
other prizes. When the Communist bloc boycotted the games, the United<br />
States won most of the medals, and most of the game pieces became winners.<br />
Trade-directed sales promotions tools include sales contests, point-of-purchase<br />
displays, dealer incentives, trade shows, and in-store demonstrations.<br />
There are many variations on the point-of-purchase display (POP). To get<br />
them in the stores requires the cooperation of the trade. On the retail shelf<br />
a POP can be a shelf talker, a mini-billboard attached to the end of the shelf<br />
with a little ad used to attract attention. Freestanding aisle displays and<br />
built-in shelf displays are other forms of POP. When a display is at the end<br />
of an aisle it is referred to as an end cap. To get those prime spots, the manufacturer<br />
must entice the retailer. A marketer can do it by providing a high<br />
markup per item or a high turnover on lower-margin items.<br />
Dealer and employee incentives: Payments made to dealers for marketing<br />
support are called spiffs. They can take the form of slotting fees, case discounts,<br />
cash payments, free merchandise, or prizes. Spiffs enable the dealer<br />
to discount, promote, or justify carrying a product. A manufacturer can also<br />
give incentives to the dealer’s employees to place store displays or award<br />
prizes for meeting sales targets.<br />
Trade shows are a way to promote a new or existing product to the<br />
wholesalers, dealers, retailers, and distributors. This promotion tries to encourage<br />
the channel participants to carry your product. A fledgling start-up<br />
company making housewares, for example, would need to attend trade<br />
shows to develop the distribution contacts that might carry their products<br />
to retail. If you have no trade contacts, you have to develop them.<br />
In-store demonstrations: Trained experts from the manufacturer are extensively<br />
used to promote products that otherwise would not generate consumer<br />
interest or be accepted by the trade. Small kitchen gadget hucksters set up<br />
demonstration platforms to bring inconspicuous blades to life by creating<br />
“beautiful” plate garnishes with ordinary vegetables. The Clinique ladies in<br />
their white<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 39<br />
smocks perform a similar mission for their boxes of “natural” beauty at the<br />
cosmetics counter.<br />
Whatever the sales promotion you may choose in a marketing mix, each<br />
element must have an explicit marketing mission to justify its cost in the<br />
marketing mix.<br />
Public Relations and Publicity. Public relations (PR) is typically a promotional<br />
tool used to communicate to a broader audience. PR is intended to<br />
create a favorable climate for your product, not to directly sell it. The list of<br />
possible PR targets can include politicians as well as the communities in<br />
which a company operates. The PR message can be intended to create<br />
goodwill, correct a mistaken impression or factual situation, or to explain a<br />
firm’s actions. Sponsorship of prestigious or charitable events or causes is<br />
often used to create a halo effect of positive feeling toward a corporation and<br />
its products. Hallmark Cards’ sponsorship of television’s Hallmark Hall of<br />
Fame aligned itself and its products with the attributes of quality, culture,<br />
and good citizenship.<br />
Because the goals of PR are less defined than a sales target, the results are<br />
more difficult to measure. Opinion polls and legislative victories are often<br />
used to measure PR success.<br />
Publicity, a form of public relations, is any unpaid form of mass media<br />
communication about a company or product. It can take the form of a news<br />
story or even the appearance of a product in the media. Publicity is a twoedged<br />
sword. It is judged as more credible by the public because it is not<br />
purchased; however, there is less control over the message. Press conferences,<br />
press releases, use by celebrities, and staged events are used to capture the<br />
media’s attention. Using a PR agency allows you to tap into their media<br />
contacts to capture an audience and hopefully control the impression made<br />
about your company or products.<br />
When tennis star Pete Sampras or Andre Agassi wears Nike shoes and<br />
sportswear at the U.S. Open, the TV can’t help but flash Nike on the screen<br />
each time he serves and volleys. This network time has great value. If the<br />
athlete makes the national evening news or Sports Illustrated, which cost<br />
$50,000 per thirty seconds and $150,000 per page, respectively, the value of<br />
free media exposure can be great.<br />
Accordingly PR executives track their effectiveness by measur-<br />
40 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
ing the value of the media time or space captured. Tracking services, such<br />
as Burrelle’s press clipping service for print, report on their clients’ PR and<br />
advertising media exposure across the country. Burrelle’s can also track<br />
competitors in the same way. Although it is often overlooked in the marketing<br />
mix, publicity can often create a tremendous impact if skillfully and<br />
creatively orchestrated.<br />
Direct Sales. Direct sales includes the realm of the Internet, junk mail, catalogs,<br />
shopping networks, and long-format TV infomercials. Direct sales are<br />
big business. Internet sales exceeded $15 billion in 1999 and are growing<br />
rapidly. In 1998 mail order sales alone constituted $465 billion in sales or 6<br />
percent of all retail sales. Over 8,000 firms mailed out 12 billion catalogs that<br />
year and the numbers are still growing. In 1999 the leading home shopping<br />
network, QVC Network Inc., had over $2 billion in sales. Infomercial companies<br />
racked up over $400 million in revenues.<br />
The nature of the direct mail game is to segment, segment, segTHE<br />
TEN-DAY MBA / 41<br />
ment. Mailers target their market with a focused mailing list to directly reach<br />
those households with a compelling mail piece. Lists can be developed internally<br />
or purchased from vendors listed in SRDS’s Direct Mail List Rates<br />
and Data directory. The more defined, affluent, and focused the list is on a<br />
desired demographic composition, the higher cost per thousand (CPM)<br />
names. The results are tracked by rate of return (ROR) and dollar amount per<br />
order. Because TV audiences lack a list’s selectivity, TV sales pitches cannot<br />
be as directly targeted as direct mail.<br />
The other component of both direct mail and TV selling is fulfillment.<br />
Fulfillment is the process of order entry, order processing, inventory management,<br />
mailing, and customer service. The dreams of those viewers of the<br />
Home Shopping Network who want to buy porcelain figurines must be<br />
fulfilled. The operation may be executed internally or subcontracted out to<br />
a fulfillment house that performs the duty for a per-order fee over certain<br />
volume minimums. It saves smaller companies the initial investment required<br />
to establish in-house fulfillment capabilities. Because direct selling is becoming<br />
such a large part of the economy, it should not be ignored as a possible<br />
channel to the consumer. A thorny issue connected with this selling method<br />
is the backlash against the “big brother” effect of having very personal information<br />
captured in mailing lists that churn out personalized pitches. This<br />
topic, like slotting fees, is a “hot” one for MBA chatter.<br />
Each method of promotion—advertising, personal selling, sales promotions,<br />
public relations, and direct selling—can accomplish a separate mission<br />
depending on the product, the place of sale, and the price. The gifted marketer<br />
goes to his or her palette of promotional options and combines them<br />
in a coordinated promotional strategy to sell the product efficiently.<br />
Product Place Promotion Price<br />
Pricing Decisions: What Should My Price Be?<br />
The pricing decision, like the product decisions, can dramatically affect the<br />
marketing mix by suggesting a channel of distribution or an advertising<br />
strategy. The pricing itself can differentiate your product from the competition.<br />
Both the Yugo and the Rolls-Royce<br />
42 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
are differentiated at opposite ends of the automobile spectrum. There are<br />
many rationales behind pricing each product and service. Haven’t you seen<br />
a pair of Nike cross-trainers for sale at $59.95 instead of $60 for some psychological<br />
advantage? Besides psychological pricing, there are eight major pricing<br />
methods and strategies suggested by research and case analyses.<br />
Cost Plus. This is a simple method of taking your cost and adding a desired<br />
profit margin. Highway contractors often use this simple method; however,<br />
it is not the proper way to price.<br />
Perceived Value to the Consumer. You can charge the customer the value<br />
provided, regardless of its cost. Replacement parts are a prime example—exorbitant<br />
prices are charged for a cheap but crucial custom nut or bolt. The<br />
owner of a fixture manufacturer confided to a group of my classmates during<br />
a school-sponsored plant visit that the majority of his company’s profits<br />
were derived from the twenty-by-twenty-foot replacement-parts cage, not<br />
from the long assembly lines producing the fixtures. If the price charged for<br />
an item is commensurate with the benefits provided, then it will be considered<br />
a good value in the mind of the buyer. But remember, there are limits<br />
even in a monopolistic situation.<br />
Skimming. Early in the introduction phase of the PLC, a company can opt<br />
to charge a high price and skim high margins from a new and novel product<br />
or service. The margins could be used to further R&amp;D, as is done in hightech<br />
industries, or to immediately reward the owners for fad product introductions.<br />
RCA used this strategy to charge high prices for color TVs when<br />
they were introduced in the 1960s.<br />
Penetration. This pricing can be used in the introductory phase or later in<br />
the PLC. A penetration strategy would use a low price to gain market share;<br />
the goal is primarily to lower costs per unit by producing many units in<br />
hopes of eventually controlling a market as the low-cost producer. The specifics<br />
of this strategy are discussed later in the Strategy chapter’s discussion<br />
of Japanese VCR production.<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 43<br />
The Price/Quality Relationship. Because consumer perceptions are not necessarily<br />
based on just the physical attributes of a product, the “perceived”<br />
quality is often influenced by its price. Apparel, perfume, and jewelry are<br />
examples where the price itself affects the perception of product attributes.<br />
Consumers often attribute the characteristics of style and workmanship to a<br />
product just because of the high price charged.<br />
Meet Competition. Strategies frequently decide to match or beat competitors’<br />
prices to gain or retain market share in a competitive market. This is especially<br />
the case in commodity products and services such as gasoline, steel,<br />
and airline tickets. The economics of pushing a product through the distribution<br />
chain, as explained in the discussion of distribution channels, has a<br />
great effect on what price a manufacturer can charge to sell his product to<br />
the distribution chain and still end up with a competitive retail price.<br />
Meet Profit Goals Based on the Size of the Market. If a market is limited in<br />
size, then a price must be charged that will allow enough profit to justify<br />
the marketing and manufacturing effort. If the product cannot command a<br />
profitable price, then to lower costs investigate either other user markets or<br />
manufacturing improvements.<br />
Price Based on the Price Elasticity of the Buyer. Price elasticity describes<br />
how a buyer’s behavior changes due to a change in price. Buyers with elastic<br />
demand do not readily accept price hikes. Their demand is greater or smaller<br />
depending on the price. Buyers with inelastic demand behaviors don’t care<br />
about price increases. They don’t decrease their quantity or frequency of<br />
purchase depending on the price. Tobacco and crack cocaine smokers, for<br />
example, have absorbed many price increases and continue to buy because<br />
their addiction makes their demand inelastic to pressure to accept price increases.<br />
If elastic, buyers will not pay more than a given price point and will<br />
stop buying or buy much less based on the intensity of their desires, their<br />
personal disposable income, or their psychological price thresholds. For-<br />
44 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
mer New York City mayor Edward Koch proposed in the 1980s that the<br />
bridge tolls onto Manhattan Island be raised to ten dollars to reduce the<br />
city’s gridlock traffic conditions. He believed that the majority of the driving<br />
public’s demand would be elastic to such a price increase.<br />
There are many avenues that may be taken with any given product. In<br />
the case of my gourmet packaged coffee, a distinctive coffee “product” may<br />
require a distinctive package, a higher “price,” a targeted promotion, and a<br />
selective “place” for distribution. But what really tells the story is the economics.<br />
Can I do it and make money?<br />
6. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMICS OF MY PLAN?<br />
Consumer → Market → Competition → Distribution → Marketing →<br />
Mix →Determine the Economics→ Revise<br />
This may be the last step of marketing analysis. This step may also send the<br />
marketing manager directly back to Go without collecting two hundred<br />
dollars. By that I mean that the consumer analysis may be exemplary, the<br />
marketing mix masterful, but it just doesn’t make money. The costs may be<br />
too high, the market price too low. Perhaps unrealistically high sales volume<br />
may be needed to break even. In those sad cases the entire circular process<br />
of marketing strategy must be restarted in an effort to find a profitable<br />
solution. To determine whether you have created a plan that is both profitable<br />
and reasonable you must address several issues.<br />
What are the costs?<br />
What is the break even?<br />
How long is the payback of my investment?<br />
What are my costs? Fixed or variable?<br />
The first cost question for a marketing manager should be, “Which of my<br />
costs are variable and which are fixed?” If this sounds like accounting, it is.<br />
Variable costs are those that vary with the volume of products sold or<br />
manufactured. The costs of materials and labor are variable<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 45<br />
costs. As more units are sold or manufactured, the total costs of material<br />
and labor are higher. Fixed costs do not vary with volume even if no sales<br />
are made. As volume fluctuates neither rent nor supervisor salaries<br />
change—within a relevant range. By that I mean that if sales triple, a new<br />
factory may have to be leased, and thus fixed costs will go up. Promotional<br />
expenses such as advertising are also seen as a fixed cost of a marketing<br />
plan, because if the product is a flop the advertising dollars are already spent.<br />
They are considered sunk costs—after a TV ad airs, the dollars are “sunk” in<br />
the ocean of TV land. Total costs are a combination of both variable and<br />
fixed costs.<br />
Total Costs = Variable Costs Per Unit (VC) × Units Sold + Fixed Costs (FC)<br />
They can also be shown graphically as follows:<br />
Wooden End Table Production<br />
46 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
What can be seen in the graphs is that regardless of unit volume, the fixed<br />
costs remain constant. When units are actually produced, variable costs are<br />
added on top of the fixed costs to equal total costs.<br />
What is my break even and is it reasonable?<br />
Break even is the point at which the fixed costs are recovered from the sale<br />
of goods but no profit is made. Promotion and manufacturing are very expensive.<br />
A way must be found to recoup those investments. That’s the whole<br />
point of marketing: to recover costs and make profits.<br />
(Unit Contribution = Your Selling Price – Variable Costs)<br />
Using my data from the coffee industry, I have provided an example from<br />
the real world. I determined that the prices and costs of a proposed marketing<br />
plan for the Mexican gourmet coffee were:<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 47<br />
Cost Cost Type<br />
Retail Sales Price $6.00 lb.<br />
Selling Price to Distributors 4.20 lb.<br />
Coffee Beans Cost 1.00 lb. Variable<br />
Roasting and Processing .44 lb Variable<br />
Cost<br />
Packaging Cost .55 lb. Variable<br />
Shipping Cost .25 lb. Variable<br />
Spiffs and Slotting Fees 50,000 Fixed<br />
Production Equipment 12,000 Fixed<br />
Rental<br />
Promotional Efforts 150,000 Fixed<br />
The corresponding break-even volume was calculated:<br />
And the break-even dollar sales were:<br />
108,163 lbs. × $6.00 lb. = $648,978 break-even retail sales<br />
The same equation can be used to calculate a target volume to yield a desired<br />
profit.<br />
To return a $30,000 profit target, you just add the profit to the numerator<br />
with the fixed costs.<br />
48 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
One very important aspect of this analysis is that it does not include the<br />
costs that were “sunk” in the development of the product or the ad campaign<br />
if they have already been spent. The evaluation of the economics is always<br />
performed from the perspective of the present. There should not be any<br />
crying over spilled milk. You need to decide if you can make money on the<br />
proposed marketing spending in the future. For example, if the coffee blend<br />
was the product of millions of dollars of research, that would be irrelevant<br />
to the decision to whether I should spend additional money to market it. If<br />
I include the millions of research, it would be a definite “no go.” However,<br />
with that money down the drain, it might be profitable to invest additional<br />
cash in a marketing effort.<br />
The graphical representation of the marketing plan economics for the<br />
Mexican coffee looked like this:<br />
Gourmet Coffee Marketing Plan Economics<br />
Is my break even reasonable in relation to my relevant market? Answering this<br />
question must be your next step. In the coffee example,<br />
THE TEN-DAY MBA / 49<br />
$648,978 of break-even retail sales was a .26 percent share of the $248 million<br />
market for gourmet, nonflavored coffee sold through the supermarket<br />
channel as explained earlier in the chapter. The targeted retail sales of<br />
$740,814 equaled only a .3 percent share of the relevant market. On that level,<br />
the plan appeared reasonable if I believed $150,000 of promotion and $50,000<br />
of dealer incentives could have produced $740,814 in sales. Imagine that—I<br />
could have reached my goal with only a .3 percent share of the market!<br />
Unfortunately, a small target share can easily lead you to believe that it<br />
is easy to obtain. How fierce was the fight for the grocers’ shelf? If my coffee<br />
got on the shelf, somebody else’s had to be kicked off. How would they react?<br />
Once in the supermarket, would my company have been willing to continue<br />
to support the coffee when a competitor went after my shelf space? In my<br />
case, the company was not willing yet to make that kind of long-term commitment<br />
to coffee.<br />
What is the payback period on my investment?<br />
This is another hurdle frequently used by companies to evaluate marketing<br />
projects when they have many to choose from. Companies want to know<br />
how long it will take just to get their investment back. Forget about profit.<br />
The payback formula is:<br />
In the coffee example, the calculation would be:<br />
If the yearly profit is not the same each year, there is no formula. The<br />
break-even point is where the plan returns the initial investment.<br />
Seven years is a bit long for a risky venture. This may indicate that the<br />
whole marketing development process should start again. And unfortunately<br />
for me it did.<br />
50 / STEVEN SILBIGER<br />
7. GO BACK AND REVISE THE PLAN<br />
Consumer → Market → Competition → Distribution → Marketing →<br />
Mix → Economics →Revise the Plan<br />
At this stage of disappointment, I revisited the marketing strategy development<br />
process outlined at the beginning of this chapter. In circumstances such as<br />
those I faced, you must either tweak or discard your plans entirely. You may<br />
have something that can be salvaged…if you’re lucky. You have to start by<br />
asking yourself tough questions. In the case of the coffee project I tormented<br />
myself with:<br />
Should I target another segment?<br />
Is the mail order distribution channel an option?<br />
Should I not advertise and rely on a cheap price to move my product?<br />
As these questions indicate, the marketing process is not easily defined<br />
or executed. It can be frustrating because there are no “right” answers.<br />
Consumer reactions cannot be easily predicted. It takes creativity, experience,<br />
skill, and intuition to develop a plan that makes sense and works together<br />
(internally consistent and mutually supportive). Marketing also requires close<br />
attention to the numbers to be successful. With this chapter you are armed<br />
with the MBA problem-solving structure and the MBA vocabulary to attack<br />
the marketing challenges that you may encounter. You haven’t even paid a<br />
dollar in tuition, sat through a class, or anted up for an expensive executive<br />
seminar. Figure the break even on that investment!<br />
I include the following notes that we all passed among ourselves at school<br />
to guide our case discussions and tests (open notes). These are the key<br />
questions that must be addressed by a comprehensive marketing strategy.<br />
